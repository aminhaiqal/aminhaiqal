## 🛠️ Builder. Learner. Problem Solver.

I don't just write code—I build things. Whether it's automating tedious workflows, crafting scalable systems, or experimenting with new languages, I'm driven by the joy of creating solutions that matter.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

Right now, I'm in my **learning era**—diving deep into **Go** before making the leap to **Rust**. Because why stick to one language when you can master them all?

I believe in:
- **Building in public** and sharing what I learn
- **Solving real problems** with elegant code
- **Experimenting fearlessly** with new technologies
- **Shipping fast**, iterating faster

### 💡 Recent Wins

- **Automated legislative bill tracking** that slashed processing time from hours to minutes at ARMO
- **Full-stack web platforms** that handle thousands of daily requests without breaking a sweat
- **Cloud-based solutions on AWS** that scale effortlessly and stay reliable under pressure

### 🧰 Languages & Tools I Wield

**Currently mastering:**
- Go (my current obsession)
- Python, TypeScript, Java
- Docker, AWS, and the cloud ecosystem

**Next on the radar:**
- Rust (the final boss)

### 🌱 Philosophy

Technology evolves. I evolve with it. Every project is a chance to learn something new, push boundaries, and build something people actually want to use.

I'm not here to just maintain codebases—I'm here to **ship products**, **solve problems**, and **make an impact**.

### 🤝 Let's Build Together

Got an idea? A challenging problem? Or just want to geek out about tech? I'm always down to collaborate on projects that push the envelope.

**Drop me a message**—let's turn ideas into reality.
